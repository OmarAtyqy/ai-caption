"""
This module implements the Encoder class, which is used to extract features from images using the Xception model.
For dimensions (299, 299):
The output of the xcpetion model, which is a (batch, 10, 10, 2048) array, is reshaped into a (batch, 100, 2048) array.
We also reshape the importance features, which are (batch, 2048) arrays, into (batch, 1, 2048) arrays.
Both the reshaped xception features and the reshaped importance features are concatenated to form a (batch, 101, 2048) array.
This array is then fed to a Dense layer, which converts it into a (batch, 101, 256) array with a relu activation function.
